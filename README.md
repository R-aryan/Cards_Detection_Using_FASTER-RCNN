# Cards Detection Using FASTER RCNN

- End to end object detection project using Faster RCNN.
- The training is done using TFOD1.14(Tensorflow object detection) framework.
- The application is served as an REST API using Flask.
- Faster RCNN paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf).
